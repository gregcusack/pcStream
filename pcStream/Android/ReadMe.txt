In this folder you will find the resources and basic documentation for a framework that implements pcStream on Android devices.
If the user desires to access low level features, he/she may also install the ExposedFramework and then access these features.

Please note that this framework for Android is a work in progress. 
Thus, Researchers and developers interested in pcStream should look at the R implementation published on GitHub.
